	1.2. missing libncurses.so.5
	You are trying to run a 32-bit binary on a 64-bit system. You need to delete the link you created, and instead install libncurses5:i386 so that you have the 32-bit version installed as well. It should be ported to Multi-Arch in 12.40, but you may have problems with some libraries and applications as not all of them are ported on 12.04.

		find dnw2.c then compile in your 64bit computer
